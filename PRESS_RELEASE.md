# Stanford University Unlocks Google Earth Engine for Students and Researchers

## Collaboration Brings Cutting-Edge Geospatial Analysis Tools to Campus

Stanford University has successfully launched a collaborative initiative enabling students and researchers to access Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources through streamlined, university-backed infrastructure. After months of coordination between the [Stanford Geospatial Center](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/stanford-geospatial-center), [Stanford Libraries' Research Data Services](https://library.stanford.edu/libraries/research-data-services), the [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/), and [University Information Technology](https://uit.stanford.edu/), the partnership has removed longstanding barriers that previously restricted access to Earth Engine's powerful Python API. This tool is essential for modern geospatial science and environmental research.

"This collaboration represents a genuine commitment to shared research infrastructure, for all researchers, across Stanford," said a representative of the initiative. "By bringing together expertise from multiple departments, we've created a solution that benefits not just our students, but faculty and researchers across the university."

## Addressing a Growing Research Need

Historically, Stanford's research community lacked direct access to the Earth Engine Python API, despite the platform's widespread adoption in climate science, agricultural monitoring, and environmental analysis. The browser-based Code Editor remained available, but the Python API required complex billing and account management infrastructure. This made it impractical for academic institutions seeking to integrate Earth Engine computations into broader data workflows, automate analyses, and leverage advanced programming techniques.

The limitation proved particularly acute as Stanford's commitment to environmental research and sustainability grew. Researchers in the [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/), Earth System Science programs, and across the university increasingly needed access to petabytes of satellite imagery, climate datasets, and geospatial tools maintained by Earth Engine. The [Earth Engine dataset catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/) contains hundreds of publicly available datasets ready for analysis.

## A Collaborative Solution

Recognizing this gap, Stanford's research computing leadership coordinated closely across multiple departments over several months to develop a solution that leverages Google's non-billing pathway for Earth Engine use. The resulting infrastructure streamlines the process for Stanford-affiliated users to create university-managed GCP projects dedicated exclusively to Earth Engine, register projects as non-commercial research, enable the Earth Engine API, and access the Python API with authenticated university credentials.

The process, designed with student researchers in mind, takes approximately 15 minutes from start to finish and requires no billing information.

## Impact and Scope

The initiative directly supports Stanford's strategic priorities in environmental science, climate research, and data-driven sustainability. Students and faculty now have immediate access to NASA and ESA satellite imagery archives spanning decades, pre-processed geospatial datasets from leading environmental research programs, cloud-based computational infrastructure requiring no local hardware investment, and seamless integration with Python, R, and JavaScript workflows. Explore the full range of available data in the [Earth Engine dataset catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/).

Early users report that moving to GCP unlocks not just the Python API, but also improved performance, faster processing times, and higher computational quotas compared to the legacy Earth Engine interface.

## About Google Earth Engine

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based geospatial analysis platform providing visualization and computational tools used by researchers, scientists, and developers worldwide for climate science, agricultural monitoring, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. The platform hosts petabytes of publicly available satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, including Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, and hundreds of community-contributed datasets. Browse all available [datasets in the Earth Engine catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/).

## Getting Started
