# Email Snippet for New GIS Users Workgroup Members

---

**Subject:** Welcome to the GIS Users Workgroup — Your Earth Engine Access is Ready

---

Welcome to the Stanford Geospatial Center's **GIS Users Workgroup**! You now have access to the Stanford Geospatial Center at Branner Library, network storage (R: drive), and the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).

We've also added you to our GCP workgroup for student access, which unlocks increased quotas, improved performance, and access to the Earth Engine Python API. This is the key upgrade that enables Python automation and integration with your research workflows.

**Quick setup (about 15 minutes):**

1. Sign out of Google completely, clear your browser cache, and sign back in
2. Open [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) and go to Cloud Project menu
3. Create a new project in the `gee_student` folder
4. Complete the two prompts: confirm non-commercial use and enable the Earth Engine API
5. Test your setup: [Earth Engine Python API Verification Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/guides/linked/ee-api-colab-setup.ipynb) (replace `project_folder` in the second code block with your project name)

If you encounter any issues, contact us at stanford-geospatial@stanford.edu with a screenshot if possible. Your feedback helps us improve the documentation.

## Resources

For Earth Engine learning and support, we recommend:
