    "*   **Browser Authentication (Recommended for Beginners):** This is the easiest method. GEE will open a browser window to allow you to log in with your Google account.\n",

    "**What happens when you run this cell:**\n",
    "\n",

    "2. If you haven't authenticated yet, it will fail and catch the error\n",
    "3. It then runs `ee.Authenticate()` which opens your web browser\n",

    "5. After successful authentication, it runs `ee.Initialize()` again to connect to Earth Engine\n",
    "6. Finally, it prints a confirmation message\n",

    "- **Run cells in order**: Each cell depends on results from previous cells. Running them out of order may cause errors.\n",
    "- **Wait for output**: GEE operations can take a few seconds. Wait for the output before running the next cell.\n",
    "- **Watch the console**: Print statements help you understand what's happening at each step. They're like \"signposts\" in your analysis.\n",
    "- **Zoom and pan the maps**: Click and drag to pan, use the mouse wheel or +/- buttons to zoom. This helps you understand what the data actually looks like.\n",
    "- **Check file paths**: When exporting files, make sure the `output/` directory exists. The code creates it automatically, but it's good to know where it is.\n"

    "## Understanding Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, let's understand some core remote sensing and Google Earth Engine concepts that will help you understand what we're doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Remote Sensing?\n",
    "Remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about objects or areas from a distance—typically using satellites. These satellites carry instruments (called \"sensors\") that measure different wavelengths of light reflected by Earth's surface. By analyzing these different wavelengths, we can identify fires, vegetation, water, and other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Google Earth Engine (GEE)?\n",
    "Google Earth Engine is a free cloud-based platform that holds decades of satellite imagery and makes it easy to analyze this data programmatically. Instead of downloading massive files to your computer, you send your analysis code to Google's servers, which do the heavy lifting and return just the results you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key GEE Objects You'll See\n",
    "\n",
    "**ImageCollection**: A collection is like a \"folder\" of satellite images. The FIRMS dataset is an ImageCollection that contains fire detections from many satellite passes. Each image has multiple \"bands\" (different measurements of the same area—e.g., brightness temperature in different infrared wavelengths).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometry**: In GEE, geometry defines the area of interest (AOI). It can be a point, line, polygon, or rectangle. We'll use a rectangle covering the entire world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Operations**: GEE lets you perform mathematical operations on images. For example, `fires.gt(100)` means \"create a new image where pixels hotter than 100°C are marked as 1 (true) and colder pixels are marked as 0 (false).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Server-side vs. Client-side**: Most GEE operations happen on Google's servers (server-side), which is very fast. When you call `.getInfo()`, you're asking GEE to send the results back to your computer (client-side), which is slower. We try to minimize `.getInfo()` calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Reducer?\n",
    "A reducer in GEE is a function that combines (reduces) data across space or time. For example, `ee.Reducer.minMax()` finds the minimum and maximum values across all pixels in an area. Think of it as \"summarizing\" a large image down to one or a few numbers.\n"
