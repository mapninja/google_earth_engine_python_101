# GCP Press release	

What is Google Earth Engine

Background of GEE at Stanford for students

The legacy gee problem

The solution: GEE doesn’t require billing so we've created the ability for Stanford Researchers to create GCP projects for use with GEE (only)

History and thanks of Working with UIT and SDSS IT to create the new capabilities

How to get access to GEE and GCP at Stanford

What to do once you have access:Current email snippet to new users:I’ve added you to the GIS Users Workgroup, which gives you login access to our machines at the Stanford Geospatial Center at Branner Library, storage space on our network server, mapped as your R: drive on our lab machines, as well as access to Google Earth Engine. 

I’ve also added you to our new early access group for Google Cloud Project creation, when using Earth Engine. You will be guided through a process to create a GCP Project, register your project as a non-commercial project, as well as enabling the Google Earth  Engine API, before you can then select the project for use in Google Earth Engine. Once you have gone through the process and attached the project to your Google Earth Engine account, you should be able to access the Earth Engine Python API, which was not available to students, previously. 

Use the following to authenticate and see basic usage of the Python API:

Look for a new Google Earth Engine 101 - The Python API workshop in the near future!

Stanford Geospatial Center's "Google Earth Engine: An Introduction for Complete Beginners"
The Stanford Geospatial Center teaches "Google Earth Engine: An Introduction for complete beginners" on a regular basis. You can find out when we will be teaching this, and other workshops, on our Stanford Geospatial Center Events page.

We have a self-paced version of the Google Earth Engine 101 workshop, which can be accessed at your convenience.

The awesome-gee-community-catalog
https://gee-community-catalog.org/

The awesome-gee-community-catalog consists of community sourced geospatial datasets made available for use by the larger Google Earth Engine community and shared publicly as Earth Engine assets. The project was started with the idea that a lot of research datasets are often unavailable for direct use and require preprocessing before use. This catalog lives and serves alongside the Google Earth Engine data catalog and also houses datasets that are often requested by the community and under a variety of open license.

You can read about the history and how this project started in the Medium Post article here

The GEE Text-book: "Cloud-Based Remote Sensing with Google Earth Engine: Fundamentals and Applications"
https://www.eefabook.org/

This book is the product of more than a year of effort from more than 100 individuals, working in concert to provide this free resource for learning how to use this exciting technology for the public good.
​The book includes work from undergraduates, master’s students, PhD students, postdocs, assistant professors, associate professors, and independent consultants.

Geo for Good Summit
https://earthoutreachonair.withgoogle.com/events/geoforgood23

The annual, free, invitation-only summit for nonprofit, academic, public sector, private sector, and Indigenous peoples and local communities who are using (or want to learn to use) Google's mapping tools (such as Google Earth, Earth Engine, Environmental Insights Explorer, and My Maps) for planetary sustainability and human resilience around the world. The summit is a full week of plenaries, workshops, hands-on technical sessions and, most importantly, myriad opportunities to network other Earth Engine users and the Google Earth Outreach Team, including the developers of Google Earth Engine.
